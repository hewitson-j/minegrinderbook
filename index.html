                <p class="paragraphs">Mine Grinder is a thriller that grabs you as it chronicles the last trip of lifelong friends out for one
last hurrah. It is a reverent nod to the legacy of the 80’s horror movie genre that will unnerve you
as you turn the pages. Horror fans will love the bloody misfortune into a forbidden mining town’s
secret past, Abismo de la Plata, The Silver Abyss as it was named. Surrounded by darkness,
the friends only have themselves to rely on as a mine collapse traps them and a robotic
executioner aims to slaughter them, one by one. Chased by the cold machine that is as
methodical as any serial killer in any story that came before. It is a story of pain and graphic
death that spirals into the weaved web of a historically insane genius left from the mine’s past.
What secrets does the darkness of Abismo de la Plata hold and can they find their way out
before they become lost to the legend of the Silver Abyss?</p>

                        Dave “Huey” Hewitson was born in the 70’s and from an early age loved watching movies. Huey’s mom started him off with musicals but as he got older, he started watching fantasy like Krull and Willow, sci-fi like Wrath of Khan and ROTJ and action, anything with Jean-Claude, Segal or Arnold. After working at a video store in the summer of 1989, Huey became fascinated with the Horror genre, Michael, Freddy and Chuckie being his big three. Every night, after Huey closed up, he would bring home a horror movie, a box of Hostess Ding Dongs and a gallon of milk. Huey and his dad, a funeral director (Phantasm being his dad’s favorite movies), would finish all three before the night was over. This is Huey’s debut entry in writing. He wanted to create a character that would become equal to the 80’s predecessors. “Respectfully, I do miss the old campy stuff. Let’s just have some fun.”
